"""Comment-language ratchet for this repository.

Everything here ships to users, so the text a reader of the source has to
understand is English-only: Python comments, docstrings, and diagnostics,
``#`` comments in the config files, and Markdown prose -- plus
TypeScript/JavaScript, CSS, and HTML comments for the Portal frontend. (The
source tree this was ported from also held ``.drawio.svg`` diagrams to this
rule; this repository ships none, so that check is dropped rather than
left vacuous -- add it back, with its own test, the day a diagram lands
here.)

Japanese the product itself emits stays untouched — the strings it speaks
and returns, and fenced code samples, are output, not explanation. (This
repository ships no runtime text file of its own the way an agent's system
prompt would be one; if one is ever added, list it in ``RUNTIME_TEXT_FILES``
the same way the source tree this was ported from does.)

Files that still carry Japanese are listed in ``JAPANESE_COMMENT_DEBT``. The
list is empty and locked empty by a test: the tree is fully English, so a new
file is translated rather than parked on a list.

Every shipped file must answer to one of those checks, be a binary asset, or
be recorded in ``UNCHECKED_BY_DESIGN`` with the reason it carries no prose —
a format this module has never seen fails rather than passing unexamined.
