"""Publication hygiene: content that must never ship in this repository.

This tree publishes as-is and its history is permanent: anything that lands
in a commit stays visible in clones and forks forever. This contract fails
the pull request that introduces secret material, while the mistake is
still revertible.

Only patterns that are themselves harmless to publish belong here.
